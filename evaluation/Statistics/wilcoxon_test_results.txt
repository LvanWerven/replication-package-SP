*** Applying Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (Alpha = 0.05) ***
Data used: Paired domain scores.

--- Main RQ: Overall Performance ---
H0: No significant difference between techniques for F1_Score.
Test Metric: F1-Score (Technique A vs Technique B)
Wilcoxon W Statistic: 2.0000
P-value (Exact): 0.0234
Conclusion: REJECT H0: There IS a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).
--------------------------------------------------

--- RQ1: Must-Have Classes Performance ---
H0: No significant difference between techniques for F1_Score_Must_Have.
Test Metric: F1-Score (Technique A vs Technique B)
Wilcoxon W Statistic: 16.0000
P-value (Exact): 0.8438
Conclusion: FAIL TO REJECT H0: There is NO statistically significant difference (p >= 0.05).
--------------------------------------------------

--- RQ2: Should-Have Classes Performance ---
H0: No significant difference between techniques for F1_Score_Should_Have.
Test Metric: F1-Score (Technique A vs Technique B)
Wilcoxon W Statistic: 1.0000
